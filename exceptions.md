# Exception Handling Interview Questions & Answers

## What is an Exception in Java ?

An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. It
is an object that represents an error or an unexpected condition that arises during the runtime of a program.

## What is the difference between ClassNotFoundException and NoClassDefFoundError ?

- ClassNotFoundException: This exception is thrown when an application tries to load a class through its string name
  using methods like `Class.forName()`, `ClassLoader.loadClass()`, or `ClassLoader.findSystemClass()`, but the class
  with the specified name cannot be found in the classpath. It is a checked exception, which means it must be declared
  in the method signature or handled using a try-catch block.
- NoClassDefFoundError: This error is thrown when the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) or a class loader tries to load a
  class, but the class definition is not found. This can happen if the class was present during compile time but is
  missing at runtime. It is an unchecked error, which means it does not need to be declared or caught.

## What is the finalize keyword in Java ?

The `finalize` method in Java is a protected method of the `Object` class that is called by the garbage collector
before an object is removed from memory. It is used to perform cleanup operations, such as releasing resources or
closing
connections, before the object is destroyed. However, the use of `finalize` is generally discouraged in favor of
other resource management techniques, such as try-with-resources and explicit resource management.

## What is Exception Chaining in Java ?

Exception chaining is a technique in Java that allows one exception to be wrapped inside another exception. This
is useful when you want to provide more context about an error that occurred, while still preserving the original
exception. In Java, you can chain exceptions by passing the original exception as a cause to the new exception using the
constructor of the new exception class.
Example:

```java
public static void performOperation() throws CustomApplicationException {
    try {
        // Simulate an underlying operation that might throw an IOException
        readFile("nonexistent.txt");
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // Wrap the IOException in a custom application-specific exception
        throw new CustomApplicationException("Error performing file operation", e);
    }
}
```

## What is stack trace and how it is related to an Exception ?

A stack trace is a report that provides information about the sequence of method calls that led to an exception being
thrown in a program. It is generated by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) when an exception occurs and is printed to the
standard error stream. The stack trace includes the name of the exception, the message associated with it, and a list
of method calls that were active at the time the exception was thrown, along with the line numbers in the source code
where each method was called.

## Differentiate between checked and unchecked exceptions in Java ?

- Checked Exceptions: These are exceptions that are checked at compile-time. They must be either caught using a
  try-catch
  block or declared in the method signature using the `throws` keyword. Examples include `IOException`, `SQLException`,
  and `ClassNotFoundException`.
- Unchecked Exceptions: These are exceptions that are not checked at compile-time. They are subclasses of
  `RuntimeException`
  and do not need to be declared or caught. Examples include `NullPointerException`, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`,
  and `ArithmeticException`.
- Checked exceptions are typically used for recoverable conditions, while unchecked exceptions are used for programming
  errors.
- Checked exceptions force the programmer to handle the exception, while unchecked exceptions do not.
- Checked exceptions can lead to more robust code, while unchecked exceptions can lead to cleaner code.
- Checked exceptions can be more difficult to work with, while unchecked exceptions can be easier to work with.

## What are the runtime exceptions in Java ?

Runtime exceptions are a type of unchecked exception in Java that occur during the execution of a program. They are
subclasses of the `RuntimeException` class and do not need to be declared or caught. Some common examples of runtime
exceptions in Java include:

- `NullPointerException`: Thrown when an application attempts to use a null object reference.
- `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`: Thrown when an application tries to access an array with an illegal index.
- `ArithmeticException`: Thrown when an exceptional arithmetic condition occurs, such as division by zero.
- `ClassCastException`: Thrown when an application tries to cast an object to a subclass of which it is not an instance.

## What is exception handling in Java and what are the advantages of exception handling ?

Exception handling in Java is a mechanism that allows developers to handle runtime errors in a controlled manner. It
involves the use of try-catch blocks to catch and handle exceptions that may occur during the execution of a program.
The advantages of exception handling in Java include:

- Improved code readability: Exception handling makes the code more readable and easier to understand by separating
  error-handling logic from regular code.
- Enhanced program stability: By handling exceptions, programs can continue to run even when errors occur,
  preventing crashes and improving overall stability.
- Better resource management: Exception handling allows for proper cleanup of resources, such as closing files or
  releasing database connections, even when exceptions occur.
- Easier debugging: Exception handling provides detailed information about the nature and location of errors,
  making it easier to identify and fix issues in the code.
- Custom error handling: Developers can create custom exception classes to handle specific error conditions,
  providing more meaningful error messages and improving user experience.

## What are the best practices for exception handling in Java ?

Some best practices for exception handling in Java include:

- Use specific exception types: Catch and handle specific exceptions rather than using a generic `Exception` type.
  This helps to provide more meaningful error messages and allows for better error handling.
- Avoid catching `Throwable`: Catching `Throwable` can lead to catching errors that should not be caught, such as
  `OutOfMemoryError` or `StackOverflowError`. Instead, catch specific exceptions or `Exception`.
- Use finally blocks for cleanup: Use `finally` blocks to ensure that resources are properly cleaned up, such as closing
  files or releasing database connections, even if an exception occurs.
- Log exceptions: Use logging frameworks to log exceptions and their stack traces for debugging and troubleshooting
  purposes.
- Avoid empty catch blocks: Avoid using empty catch blocks, as they can hide errors and make debugging difficult. Always
  handle exceptions appropriately.
- Use custom exceptions: Create custom exception classes to represent specific error conditions in your application.
- Document exceptions: Document the exceptions that a method can throw using the `@throws` tag in Javadoc comments.
- Avoid using exceptions for control flow: Exceptions should be used for exceptional conditions, not for regular control
  flow in the program.

## When we should subclass Exception class in Java ?

You should subclass the `Exception` class in Java when you want to create a custom exception that represents a specific
error condition in your application. Here are some scenarios when you might consider subclassing the `Exception` class:

- Application-specific errors: When you have specific error conditions that are unique to your application and need to
  be represented as exceptions.
- Business logic errors: When you want to represent errors that occur due to violations of business rules or
  constraints.
- Checked exceptions: When you want to create a checked exception that must be declared in the method signature or
  caught in a try-catch block.
- Enhancing error information: When you want to provide additional information or context about an error that
  occurred.
- Grouping related exceptions: When you want to create a hierarchy of related exceptions for better organization and
  handling.
- Improving code readability: When you want to make your code more readable and self-explanatory by using meaningful
  exception names.

## What happens when an exception is thrown by main() method in Java ?

When an exception is thrown by the `main()` method in Java, the following sequence of events occurs:

1. The exception is propagated up the call stack to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
2. If the exception is not caught within the `main()` method or any other method in the call stack, the JVM will handle
   the
   exception.
3. The JVM will print the stack trace of the exception to the standard error stream, which includes the exception type,
   message, and the sequence of method calls that led to the exception.
4. The program will terminate, and the JVM will exit with a non-zero status code, indicating that an error occurred.
5. If the exception is caught within the `main()` method or any other method in the call stack, the program can continue
   executing based on the exception handling logic implemented in the catch block.
