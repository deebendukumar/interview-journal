## What is microservice architecture and when would you use it?

An approach where a system is built as a suite of small, independently deployable services, each running in its own
process and communicating through lightweight mechanisms, often HTTP resource APIs.

* Core principles:
    - Single Responsibility: Each microservice focuses on a specific business capability.
    - Independence: Services can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
    - Decentralized Data Management: Each service manages its own database or data storage.
    - Continuous Delivery: Facilitates frequent updates and deployments.
* When to use:
    - Complex, large-scale applications requiring scalability and flexibility.
    - Teams organized around business capabilities, allowing for independent development.
    - Systems needing rapid deployment and frequent updates.
* Benefits:
    - Improved scalability and fault isolation.
    - Enhanced flexibility in technology choices.
    - Faster development cycles and deployment.
* Challenges:
    - Increased complexity in managing multiple services.
    - Requires robust DevOps practices and infrastructure.
    - Potential for data consistency issues across services.

## What is event driven architecture and when would you use it?

A design paradigm where system components communicate through the production, detection, and reaction to events,
enabling
asynchronous processing and decoupling of components.

* Core principles:
    - Event Producers: Components that generate events when a state change occurs.
    - Event Consumers: Components that listen for and react to events.
    - Event Channels: Mechanisms for transmitting events between producers and consumers (e.g., message queues, event
      buses).
    - Asynchronous Communication: Enables non-blocking interactions between components.
* When to use:
    - Systems requiring high scalability and responsiveness.
    - Applications with complex workflows and business processes.
    - Scenarios needing decoupled components for flexibility and maintainability.
* Benefits:
    - Improved scalability and responsiveness.
    - Enhanced decoupling of components, allowing for independent development and deployment.
    - Better handling of complex workflows and business processes.
* Challenges:
    - Increased complexity in managing event flows and dependencies.
    - Requires robust monitoring and error handling mechanisms.
    - Potential for eventual consistency issues in distributed systems.

## What is layered architecture and when would you use it?

A design pattern that organizes a system into distinct layers, each with specific responsibilities, promoting separation
of concerns and modularity.

* Core principles:
    - Separation of Concerns: Each layer focuses on a specific aspect of the application (e.g., presentation, business
      logic, data access).
    - Layered Communication: Layers interact only with adjacent layers, promoting clear boundaries.
    - Modularity: Each layer can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.
* When to use:
    - Applications with well-defined responsibilities and interactions.
    - Systems requiring clear separation between user interface, business logic, and data management.
    - Scenarios where maintainability and scalability are priorities.
* Benefits:
    - Improved maintainability and testability.
    - Enhanced separation of concerns, leading to clearer architecture.
    - Easier to manage complexity through modular design.
* Challenges:
    - Potential performance overhead due to multiple layers of abstraction.
    - Risk of over-engineering for simple applications.
    - Requires careful design to avoid tight coupling between layers.

## Can you explain the differences between monolithic, SOA, and microservice architectures?

* Monolithic Architecture:
    - Single, unified codebase where all components are tightly integrated.
    - Easier to develop and deploy initially but can become complex and hard to maintain as the application grows.
    - Limited scalability; scaling requires duplicating the entire application.
* Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):
    - Decomposes the application into services that communicate over a network, often using protocols like SOAP or REST.
    - Promotes reusability and interoperability between services.
    - More complex than monolithic but allows for better scalability and flexibility.
* Microservice Architecture:
    - Further decomposes services into smaller, independently deployable units focused on specific business
      capabilities.
    - Each microservice can use different technologies and databases, promoting flexibility.
    - Requires robust DevOps practices and infrastructure to manage the complexity of multiple services.
    - Offers high scalability and fault isolation but introduces challenges in data consistency and inter-service
      communication.

## How do you ensure scalability and maintainability in solution design?

* Scalability:
    - Design for horizontal scaling by enabling the addition of more instances to handle increased load.
    - Use load balancing to distribute traffic evenly across servers.
    - Implement caching strategies to reduce database load and improve response times.
    - Opt for stateless services where possible to facilitate easier scaling.
    - Monitor performance metrics and plan for capacity based on usage patterns.
* Maintainability:
    - Follow coding standards and best practices to ensure code quality.
    - Use modular design principles to separate concerns and promote reusability.
    - Implement comprehensive documentation for architecture, code, and processes.
    - Conduct regular code reviews and refactoring to address technical debt.
    - Automate testing and deployment processes to reduce errors and improve efficiency.

## What architectural trade-offs do you commonly face between performance, cost, and flexibility?

* Performance vs. Cost:
    - High-performance solutions often require more expensive infrastructure (e.g., high-end servers, advanced caching).
    - Cost-effective solutions may sacrifice some performance by using shared resources or lower-tier services.
    - Balance by identifying critical performance requirements and optimizing only those areas.
* Performance vs. Flexibility:
    - Highly flexible architectures (e.g., microservices) may introduce latency due to inter-service communication.
    - Monolithic architectures can offer better performance but limit flexibility in development and deployment.
    - Choose architecture based on the specific needs of the application and its expected evolution.
* Cost vs. Flexibility:
    - Flexible architectures may incur higher operational costs due to complexity and management overhead.
    - Cost-effective solutions may limit the ability to adapt quickly to changing requirements.
    - Evaluate the long-term benefits of flexibility against immediate cost savings.

## How do you handle technical debt in long-lived enterprise systems?

* Identification and Assessment:
    - Regularly review codebases to identify areas of technical debt.
    - Assess the impact of technical debt on system performance, maintainability, and scalability.
    - Prioritize technical debt based on its severity and potential risks.

    - Develop a clear strategy for addressing technical debt, including timelines and resource allocation.
    - Integrate technical debt reduction into the regular development cycle (e.g., during sprints).
    - Communicate the importance of addressing technical debt to stakeholders and secure their support.
* Implementation:
    - Refactor code to improve quality and reduce complexity.
    - Update or replace outdated technologies and libraries.
    - Improve documentation to enhance understanding and maintainability.
* Monitoring and Prevention:
    - Implement coding standards and best practices to prevent the accumulation of new technical debt.
    - Use automated tools to monitor code quality and identify potential issues early.
    - Foster a culture of continuous improvement and encourage developers to address technical debt proactively.

## Can you explain the 12-factor app methodology?
The 12-factor app is a set of best practices for building modern, scalable, and maintainable web applications. The
methodology emphasizes principles that help developers create applications that can be easily deployed and managed in
cloud environments.

## How do you approach designing high-availability and fault-tolerant systems?
