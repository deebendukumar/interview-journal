# Core Architecture & Design Principles

## What are the key responsibilities of a Solution Architect in large enterprise projects?

* Requirement alignment and translation
    - Elicit, consolidate and translate business goals into technical requirements.
    - Ensure alignment between business stakeholders and technical teams.
    - Facilitate communication and collaboration across diverse teams.
* Architecture design and documentation
    - Design scalable, secure, and maintainable architecture solutions.
    - Create and maintain architecture documentation, including diagrams and specifications.
    - Ensure adherence to architectural standards and best practices.
* Technology evaluation and selection
    - Evaluate and recommend appropriate technologies, tools, and platforms.
    - Stay updated with emerging technologies and industry trends.
    - Conduct proof-of-concept (PoC) evaluations to validate technology choices.
* Risk management and mitigation
    - Identify potential risks and develop mitigation strategies.
    - Ensure compliance with regulatory and security requirements.
    - Monitor and address technical debt and legacy system challenges.
* Stakeholder engagement and management
    - Engage with business stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations.
    - Manage relationships with vendors and third-party service providers.
    - Facilitate workshops and meetings to gather feedback and ensure alignment.
* Quality assurance and governance
    - Establish and enforce architecture governance processes.
    - Conduct architecture reviews and audits to ensure quality and compliance.
    - Promote best practices in coding, testing, and deployment.
* Continuous improvement and innovation
    - Foster a culture of continuous improvement and innovation.
    - Encourage experimentation and adoption of new technologies.
    - Lead initiatives for process improvement and efficiency gains.

## How do you approach solution design for complex, distributed systems?

* Understand requirements and constraints
    - Gather detailed requirements from stakeholders.
    - Identify constraints such as budget, timeline, and regulatory compliance.
    - Analyze existing systems and their limitations.
* Define architecture principles and patterns
    - Establish guiding principles for the architecture (e.g., scalability, security, maintainability).
    - Choose appropriate architecture patterns (e.g., microservices, event-driven, layered).
    - Ensure alignment with organizational standards and best practices.
* Design for scalability and performance
    - Plan for horizontal and vertical scaling.
    - Optimize for performance through caching, load balancing, and efficient data access.
    - Consider future growth and changing requirements.
* Ensure security and compliance
    - Implement security best practices (e.g., encryption, authentication, authorization).
    - Ensure compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
    - Conduct regular security assessments and audits.
* Plan for fault tolerance and disaster recovery
    - Design for high availability and redundancy.
    - Implement backup and recovery strategies.
    - Test disaster recovery plans regularly.
* Foster collaboration and communication
    - Engage with cross-functional teams throughout the design process.
    - Use collaborative tools for documentation and communication.
    - Facilitate workshops and design reviews to gather feedback.
* Document and validate the design
    - Create detailed architecture diagrams and documentation.
    - Validate the design through reviews and prototyping.
    - Ensure all stakeholders understand and agree on the design.

## What is microservice architecture and when would you use it?

An approach where a system is built as a suite of small, independently deployable services, each running in its own
process and communicating through lightweight mechanisms, often HTTP resource APIs.
* Core principles:
    - Single Responsibility: Each microservice focuses on a specific business capability.
    - Independence: Services can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
    - Decentralized Data Management: Each service manages its own database or data storage.
    - Continuous Delivery: Facilitates frequent updates and deployments.
* When to use:
    - Complex, large-scale applications requiring scalability and flexibility.
    - Teams organized around business capabilities, allowing for independent development.
    - Systems needing rapid deployment and frequent updates.
* Benefits:
    - Improved scalability and fault isolation.
    - Enhanced flexibility in technology choices.
    - Faster development cycles and deployment.
* Challenges:
    - Increased complexity in managing multiple services.
    - Requires robust DevOps practices and infrastructure.
    - Potential for data consistency issues across services.

## What is event driven architecture and when would you use it?

Can you explain the differences between monolithic, SOA, and microservice architectures?

How do you ensure scalability and maintainability in solution design?

What architectural trade-offs do you commonly face between performance, cost, and flexibility?

How do you handle technical debt in long-lived enterprise systems?

Can you explain the 12-factor app methodology?

How do you approach designing high-availability and fault-tolerant systems?

What are some key architecture patterns you rely on (CQRS, Event-Driven, etc.)?

How do you ensure solutions are cloud-native and future-proof?
