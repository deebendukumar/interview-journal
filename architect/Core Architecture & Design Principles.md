    - Monitor and address technical debt and legacy system challenges.
* Stakeholder engagement and management
    - Engage with business stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations.
    - Manage relationships with vendors and third-party service providers.
    - Facilitate workshops and meetings to gather feedback and ensure alignment.
* Quality assurance and governance
    - Establish and enforce architecture governance processes.
    - Conduct architecture reviews and audits to ensure quality and compliance.
    - Promote best practices in coding, testing, and deployment.
* Continuous improvement and innovation
    - Foster a culture of continuous improvement and innovation.
    - Encourage experimentation and adoption of new technologies.
    - Lead initiatives for process improvement and efficiency gains.

## How do you approach solution design for complex, distributed systems?

* Understand requirements and constraints
    - Gather detailed requirements from stakeholders.
    - Identify constraints such as budget, timeline, and regulatory compliance.
    - Analyze existing systems and their limitations.
* Define architecture principles and patterns
    - Establish guiding principles for the architecture (e.g., scalability, security, maintainability).
    - Choose appropriate architecture patterns (e.g., microservices, event-driven, layered).
    - Ensure alignment with organizational standards and best practices.
* Design for scalability and performance
    - Plan for horizontal and vertical scaling.
    - Optimize for performance through caching, load balancing, and efficient data access.
    - Consider future growth and changing requirements.
* Ensure security and compliance
    - Implement security best practices (e.g., encryption, authentication, authorization).
    - Ensure compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
    - Conduct regular security assessments and audits.
* Plan for fault tolerance and disaster recovery
    - Design for high availability and redundancy.
    - Implement backup and recovery strategies.
    - Test disaster recovery plans regularly.
* Foster collaboration and communication
    - Engage with cross-functional teams throughout the design process.
    - Use collaborative tools for documentation and communication.
    - Facilitate workshops and design reviews to gather feedback.
* Document and validate the design
    - Create detailed architecture diagrams and documentation.
    - Validate the design through reviews and prototyping.
    - Ensure all stakeholders understand and agree on the design.

## What is microservice architecture and when would you use it?

An approach where a system is built as a suite of small, independently deployable services, each running in its own
process and communicating through lightweight mechanisms, often HTTP resource APIs.

* Core principles:
    - Single Responsibility: Each microservice focuses on a specific business capability.
    - Independence: Services can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
    - Decentralized Data Management: Each service manages its own database or data storage.
    - Continuous Delivery: Facilitates frequent updates and deployments.
* When to use:
    - Complex, large-scale applications requiring scalability and flexibility.
    - Teams organized around business capabilities, allowing for independent development.
    - Systems needing rapid deployment and frequent updates.
* Benefits:
    - Improved scalability and fault isolation.
    - Enhanced flexibility in technology choices.
    - Faster development cycles and deployment.
* Challenges:
    - Increased complexity in managing multiple services.
    - Requires robust DevOps practices and infrastructure.
    - Potential for data consistency issues across services.

## What is event driven architecture and when would you use it?

A design paradigm where system components communicate through the production, detection, and reaction to events,
enabling
asynchronous processing and decoupling of components.

* Core principles:
    - Event Producers: Components that generate events when a state change occurs.
    - Event Consumers: Components that listen for and react to events.
    - Event Channels: Mechanisms for transmitting events between producers and consumers (e.g., message queues, event
      buses).
    - Asynchronous Communication: Enables non-blocking interactions between components.
* When to use:
    - Systems requiring high scalability and responsiveness.
    - Applications with complex workflows and business processes.
    - Scenarios needing decoupled components for flexibility and maintainability.
* Benefits:
    - Improved scalability and responsiveness.
    - Enhanced decoupling of components, allowing for independent development and deployment.
    - Better handling of complex workflows and business processes.
* Challenges:
    - Increased complexity in managing event flows and dependencies.
    - Requires robust monitoring and error handling mechanisms.
    - Potential for eventual consistency issues in distributed systems.

## What is layered architecture and when would you use it?

A design pattern that organizes a system into distinct layers, each with specific responsibilities, promoting separation
of concerns and modularity.

* Core principles:
    - Separation of Concerns: Each layer focuses on a specific aspect of the application (e.g., presentation, business
      logic, data access).
    - Layered Communication: Layers interact only with adjacent layers, promoting clear boundaries.
    - Modularity: Each layer can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.
* When to use:
    - Applications with well-defined responsibilities and interactions.
    - Systems requiring clear separation between user interface, business logic, and data management.
    - Scenarios where maintainability and scalability are priorities.
* Benefits:
    - Improved maintainability and testability.
    - Enhanced separation of concerns, leading to clearer architecture.
    - Easier to manage complexity through modular design.
* Challenges:
    - Potential performance overhead due to multiple layers of abstraction.
    - Risk of over-engineering for simple applications.
    - Requires careful design to avoid tight coupling between layers.
