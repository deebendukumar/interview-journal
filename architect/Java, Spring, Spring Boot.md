# Java and Springboot Architect Interview Questions

## What are the advantages of using Spring Boot over traditional Spring applications?

Spring Boot simplifies the setup and development of new Spring applications by providing default configurations,
embedded servers, and a wide range of starter dependencies. It reduces boilerplate code and allows developers to focus
on business logic rather than configuration.

## How do you design microservices using Spring Cloud components?

Spring Cloud provides tools for building distributed systems, including service discovery (Eureka), configuration
management (Spring Cloud Config), circuit breakers (Hystrix), and API gateways (Zuul). When designing microservices, I
leverage these components to ensure scalability, resilience, and ease of management.

## What’s your approach to managing transactions across distributed microservices?

Managing transactions across distributed microservices can be challenging. I typically use the Saga pattern, which
breaks a transaction into a series of smaller, manageable steps. Each service performs its part of the transaction and
publishes events to notify other services. If a step fails, compensating actions are taken to revert the changes.

## How do you implement caching strategies in Spring applications?

I use Spring Cache abstraction to implement caching strategies. Depending on the use case, I choose appropriate cache
providers like Ehcache, Redis, or Caffeine. I annotate methods with @Cacheable, @CachePut, and @CacheEvict to manage
cache operations effectively.

## What are best practices for securing REST APIs in Spring Boot?

To secure REST APIs in Spring Boot, I follow best practices such as using Spring Security for authentication and
authorization, implementing OAuth2 or JWT for token-based security, validating input data, and using HTTPS to encrypt
data in transit. Additionally, I ensure proper logging and monitoring of security events.

## How do you handle performance bottlenecks in Spring Boot apps?

To handle performance bottlenecks in Spring Boot apps, I start by profiling the application to identify slow components.
I use tools like Spring Boot Actuator, JProfiler, or VisualVM for this purpose. Once identified, I optimize database
queries, implement caching, and consider asynchronous processing for long-running tasks. Additionally , I review the
application architecture for potential improvements.

## What’s the difference between @Component, @Service, and @Repository in Spring?

- @Component is a generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component.
- @Service is a specialization of @Component, indicating that the class holds business logic.
- @Repository is also a specialization of @Component, used for data access layers and provides additional
  functionalities like exception translation.

## Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous communication in Spring.

Synchronous communication involves a direct request-response interaction where the client waits for the server to
process the request and return a response. In contrast, asynchronous communication allows the client to send a request
and continue processing without waiting for an immediate response. In Spring, asynchronous communication can be
implemented using features like @Async annotation, messaging queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka), or WebSockets.

## How do you design an API gateway in a Spring Boot ecosystem?

An API gateway in a Spring Boot ecosystem can be designed using Spring Cloud Gateway. It acts as a single entry point
for all client requests, routing them to the appropriate microservices. The gateway can handle cross-cutting concerns
like authentication, rate limiting, logging, and load balancing. I configure routes, filters, and predicates to manage
traffic effectively.

## How do you integrate Spring Boot apps with messaging systems like Kafka or RabbitMQ?

To integrate Spring Boot applications with messaging systems like Kafka or RabbitMQ, I use Spring Cloud Stream or
Spring AMQP. I define message channels and bind them to the appropriate messaging middleware. I also configure message
listeners and producers to handle message consumption and production. Proper error handling and retry mechanisms are
implemented to ensure reliable message processing.
