# System design interview questions

## Design a scalable & maintainable front-end architecture

* High level principles
    - Single responsibility : components to do one thing and compose into pages    
    - Component-based architecture: Break down the UI into reusable components.
    - State management: Use libraries like Redux, MobX, or Context API for predictable state management.
    - Modularization: Organize code into modules for better maintainability and scalability.
    - Responsive design: Ensure the application works well on various devices and screen sizes.
    - Performance optimization: Implement lazy loading, code splitting, and caching strategies.
    - Testing: Use unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure code quality.

* Recommended architecture
    - Micro frontends
    - UI components 
    - State layer 
    - Service layer 
    - Infrastructure layer
    - CI/CD pipeline
    - Monitoring & logging

* Performance & scalability 
    - User service side rendering or hybrid approach
    - HTTP caching, CDN compression and resource

* Observability
    - Logging, monitoring, alerting
    - Performance monitoring
    - User analytics

* Security & compliance
